  * This API provides an easy to use framework for defining a custom global constraint for vehicle routing.
  * it is to be used when the pre-computation needs to be performed on every possible sub-sequence of route,
  * thus pre-computation is O(nÂ²)-time to achieve O(1) query time per segment.
  *
  * This particular API provides a reduction of the pre-computation time to O(n)
  * at the cost of performing the segment query in O(log(n))
  *
  * The difference in implementation is that it does not decorates evey possible segment with a value of type T.
  * Instead it decorates a subset of these segments, and each queried segment has a sequence of values of type T
  * associated with it. These values are queried from the pre-computation.
  * The assembly includes O(log(n)) of these pre-computations.

  * @param v the number of vehicles
  * @tparam T the type of pre-computation, which is on subsequences (not on nodes)
