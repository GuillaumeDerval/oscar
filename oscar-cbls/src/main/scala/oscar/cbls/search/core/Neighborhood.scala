/**
 * This is an easier way to implement your neighborhood; it provides a simplified interface and hides away searching for the best move vs. the first move
 * and the management of the acceptingCriterion.
 *
 * to implement a neighborhood, you must implement the method exploreNeighborhood
 * in this method, you evaluate moves, and to notify that a move has been
 * explored you call the method evaluateCurrentMoveObjTrueIfStopRequired(newObj:Int)
 *
 * this method tells you if the search must be stopped, or not.
 *
 * you must also implement the method instantiateCurrentMove,
 * so that the framework can actually get the current move, notably to return and comit it.
 *
 * this method must be able to return its result when you call the method evaluateCurrentMoveObjTrueIfStopRequired
 *
 * to evaluate the objective function, the Objective is in the variable obj
 *
 * @param best true if you want the best move false if you want the first acceptable move
 * @param neighborhoodName the name of the neighborhood, used for verbosities
