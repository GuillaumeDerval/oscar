/**
 * Model for the steel mill slab problem:
 * Steel is produced by casting molten iron into slabs.
 * A steel mill can produce a finite number, sigma, of slab sizes.
 * An order has two properties, a color corresponding to the route required through the steel mill and a weight.
 * Given d input orders, the problem is to assign the orders to slabs,
 * the number and size of which are also to be determined,
 * such that the total weight of steel produced is minimized.
 * This assignment is subject to two further constraints:
 *    - Capacity constraints: The total weight of orders assigned to a slab cannot exceed the slab capacity.
 *    - Color constraints: Each slab can contain at most p of k total colors (p is usually 2).
 * See problem 38 of http://www.csplib.org/ or http://becool.info.ucl.ac.be/steelmillslab
